    <h1>REPORT : LARGE COURSEWORK</h1>
    <p><b>Name :</b> NAZIA FAKHRUDDIN</p>
    <div>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <h3>Story behind website:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The idea of this website originated while working with a group
                    of teachers who teach programming in their schools and want to 
                    create an online free coding magazine, where they themselves and 
                    their students can contribute and share their programming skills to 
                    teach and inspire others to learn coding.    
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since the website inspires people of all ages, abilities and 
                    capabilities to learn coding by following simple tutorials so the 
                    name of the website CODE TO INSPIRE is chosen to reflect it.     
                </li>
                <li>
                  A focus group of people from different ages and backgrounds was used to 
                  test features of the website. Magazine like format helped people to use 
                  website with ease. 
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                  Based on feedback from people using the website the format of tutorials 
                  is based on ‘learn by doing’ so learners can follow step by step approach
                  in an easy to comprehend language.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Structure of the website:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u>Top-down structure</u> has been used, due to the needs of the users of the website,
                    which logically divides the content by breaking it up into categories. 
                </li>   
                <li>
                    It focuses first on general categories (Articles, Videos and Books). These general 
                    categories break up into individual pages.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Inspiration:</h2>
        <p>
            The inspiration for the website came from the following sources:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
             	<a href="https://codeguppy.com/">Code Guppy website,</a>gave the inspiration of creating articles
                 with tutorials which explain the process in a stepwise fashion.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/">HelloWorld Magazine for educators,</a>gave the idea 
                of the structure of a coding magazine,how accessibility is addressed like colour selection.
            </li>
            <li>
              YouTube channel of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCetWQQLtesZsA0xuqJBkoZw/videos">Simon Tiger</a> 
              who is young coding genius. 
                <ul>
                     <li>
                         He inspired me to include the work done by young learners, as children learn more quickly from each others.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                    	Not all learners can understand in a very technical language and therefore lose interest. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                       	Inclusion of videos tutorials, for learning at one’s own pace.
                    </li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Learning:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I have learned how to use Flexbox in building a responsive website.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For learning to use flexbox, I have followed <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp">W3 school</a> 
                        as well as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">CSS-tricks</a> websites,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have learned by trial and error, how to give a flex-direction: row, but can make its elements appear as columns
                        but it worked well at the end.
                    </li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>
                I have learned how Javascript can be used to manipulate             
                the HTML elements.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       For learning to use the Javascript, I have followed the lectures and W3 School. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Tried making simple manipulations like changing the size of the image.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         Then I wanted my signup form to validate the information so I found 
                         <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp">W3 School Form Validation </a> example ,
                         I learned that ‘.value ’ is required for retrieving the information. So, I tried taking  the information 
                         from the fields and when onclick function is called then showing as an alert to confirms the information .
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                I wanted to use p5.js library as advance Javascript library.
                Try use my p5.js sketch to appear on the HTML page  
                without embedding.    
                    <p>	
                        I have learned from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoXLD0Aw1YI">Daniel Shiffman YouTube video</a>
                        that it is possible to assign the HTML tag like p an id and use it as the parent of the canvas element in 
                        p5.js to make the sketch appear on the HTML page, without using canvas tag.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            So, I tried with ‘div’ instead in the Articles Page and gave it the id, which in the script.js 
                            is specified as the parent of the canvas. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At first, I used a simple 2D sketch to appear which successful. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Then I tried the 3D WEBGL sketch of mine to appear on it, which also worked. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I made the 2D sketch appear over the 3D object, using createGraphics() in p5.js library.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally, I tried adding mouse interaction inside the Javascript which worked.
                        </li>
                    </ul>   
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Evaluation 1:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I have tried many new HTML tags like audio tag, time tag, form 
                tag, input tag etc. which I think work very well as <u>tools for      
                enhancing the accessibility.</u>
            </li>
            <li>
                The <u>responsiveness of the website</u> for devices as big as laptops 
                with dimensions of 1440 x 900 to smallest mobile device of 
                dimensions of 240 x 320.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Use of Javascript</u> to manipulate either for resizing of HTML 
                element or used to collecting the information provide in the form 
                and confirming before submission or by using HTML element and 
                specifying it as parent of the p5.js library canvas function to make 
                the canvas inside the div and run the 3D sketches.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Colour selection</u> which is accessibility friendly. And consistent 
                format throughout the website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use of appropriate <u>animation effects</u> using @keyframes, ::before 
                and :hover
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Evaluation 2:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I would like to improve on my simple layout to more sophisticated,
                 but accessibility friendly layout. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Use of more Javascript to make website more dynamic. By experimenting 
                with flip book animation using Javascript or slideshow or how can you 
                download an article etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Generating SVG’s using Javascript library like paper.js,for faster upload.
            </li>
        </ol>
